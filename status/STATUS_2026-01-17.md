Summary
- Built data extractor with fan-out, token metadata cache, transfer caps, and ISO timestamps.
- Added WTF report CLI for extraction JSON.
- Added Vite + React viewer with IndexedDB cache, summaries, force graph, fullscreen, zoom/pan, pinning, and degree-based styling.

Viewer notes
- Graph now samples transfers (2,000 cap) and stats sample (5,000 cap).
- Fullscreen graph toggles on demand; scroll zoom, drag pan, press P to pin nodes.
- Tokens without transfers now connect via balance edges.

Next steps
- Adjust graph density if needed (tune force params or reduce asset nodes).
- Validate graph performance on large JSON files.
- Optionally add degree scale labels (min/median/max).
