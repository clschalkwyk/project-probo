Summary
- Added README data leeching mermaid diagram with a short prose explanation.
- Viewer polish: stabilized graph hover, moved cached files to a drawer, added trust panel (score/label/reasons/infra/base features), and added a "Trust caution" badge.
- Viewer layout tweaks: total flow moved into stats row, fan-out panel removed, list metrics tightened.
- Added `docs/explanations.md` mapping trust codes to features and infra detector logic.
- Added `scripts/uppercase_exchanges.py` to uppercase addresses in `data/exchanges.csv`.

Next steps
- Decide which 10 demo addresses to fully scan and extract/enrich.
- Review and tune viewer trust badge criteria and feature ordering.
- Validate the new README and viewer copy against current analysis outputs.
